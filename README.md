# Todos App

This is a simple Todos app built with Create React App. It allows users to add tasks and save them in the browser's local storage so that tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

This project was built as part of a [React learning course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agx66oZnT6IyhcMIbUMNMdt&si=2ZHtp_pBdyF5uVG5) to gain practical experience with React fundamentals.

## Features

- Add a new todo item
